/* Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”
Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age. */

var doggyAge = 6; // Declaring the dogs' age as 6, for 6 years.
var doggyAgeAsHumanYears = 6 * 7; // Multiplies Sparky's age by 7 to return the value of his human age to the 'doggyAgeAsHumanYears' variable
document.write("Sparky is " + doggyAge + " years old, so he is " + doggyAgeAsHumanYears + " years old in human years.");
