// INDUSTRIAL CALCULATOR
// This calculator will calculate the amount of email you'd read a day based on the amount of time you plan to spend reading your email, and it will also tell you if you'll have enough time to read all of the emails you plan to within a certain span of time.

var emails = prompt("How many emails would you like to read in total?"); // Amount of emails you plan to read
var readingPerDay = prompt("How many emails do you plan to read each day?"); // Amount of emails you plan to read each day
var time = prompt("How much time are you going to spend reading these emails on a daily basis?"); // Amount of hours you plan to spend reading the emails each day
