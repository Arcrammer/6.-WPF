// INDUSTRIAL CALCULATOR
// This calculator will calculate the amount of email you'd read a day based on the amount of time you plan to spend reading your email, and it will also tell you if you'll have enough time to read all of the emails you plan to within a certain span of time.

var emails = ; // Amount of emails you plan to read
var readingPerDay = ; // Amount of emails you plan to read each day
var time = ; // Amount of hours you plan to spend reading the emails each day
